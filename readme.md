Instructions for setting up a new computer
==========================================

These are just some (incomplete) instructions of things I like to do to get a Mac ready for development and use.

Development
-----------

1. Install Xcode from the App Store.
2. Install the Command Line Tools from Xcode.
3. Disable documentation downloads in Xcode.
4. Install Homebrew.
5. Install rbenv, ruby-build, ruby 1.9.3-p327 (or higher).
6. Set up SSH keys for Github.
7. Clone important repos (like this one!).
